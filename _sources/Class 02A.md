## TI Kit Activity #1b: TI Kit - Basics

### Purpose of this Activity

This activity introduces you to the TI kits and the Energia IDE. You will be introduced to basic Arduino code to execute commands inside of Energia using various built-in features of the TI kits.  

TI Kits will be utilized throughout this course to solve various problems while building your skills to allow teams to utilize them as part of their solution to their design project.

```{admonition} Note
:class: Attention
**Communication errors between the TI Kits and your computer:**
1.	Make sure that your TI Kit is plugged in correctly using the provided Micro 
USB to USB A cable. There should be a green power LED lit up when this occurs.
2.	The COM port selected in Energia is not the correct port. While it is 
generally the highest port number available. This is not always the case. All 
COM Ports should be tried if there are communication issues. 
3.	Ensure all drivers have been installed. For instructions on how to install, 
please see Step 2 in Getting Started. 
4.	Restart Energia IDE
5.	Restart your computer (Should not be required, but can help depending on 
your computerâ€™s settings)

**Submission Instructions:**
1.	Re-name your answer sheet as, ENGR131_ICA02A_Table#.docx, where table# is 
your current ENGR 131 table. 
2.	Save your files to your Purdue Career Account (This is your Purdue storage 
space. For more information see 
https://www.itap.purdue.edu/connections/careeraccount) 
3.	Submit your work through the designated Brightspace In-Class Activity Drop 
Box at https:/purdue.brightspace.com/

```

### Task 1: Communication between the TI Kit and Your Computer Serial Port

#### Goal
This task tests your ability to upload a sketch to the TI Kit board 
demonstrating that the TI kit can communicate with the computer. To do this, 
you will need to complete the following:
1.	Open the {download}`Serial_Data_Test <class_files\class02a\Serial_Data_Test.ino>`
file in Energia. 
2.	Compile and upload the Serial_test sketch to your TI Kit.
3.	Open the Serial Monitor located in the Tools Menu to complete question 2. 

```{figure} ./figures/class02a/energia_capture.png

Serial Monitor Location
```

4.	Close the Serial Monitor and open the Serial Plotter located in the Tools 
Menu to complete question 3. 

After completeing the steps above, answer the following questions:

1.	Draw (by hand or via a computer) a block diagram of your set up on your 
answer document. 
2.	Take and upload a screenshot of the Serial Monitor window when 25 data 
points have been taken.
3.	 Take and upload a screenshot of the Serial Plotter window when 500 seconds 
of data have been taken.

#### Reference Code
```c
#define sensorPin A2

void setup() {
   // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  //analogReference(INTERNAL);
 
}

void loop() {
  // Convert the analog reading (which goes from 0 - 1023) to a voltage (0 - 5V):
  // get the temperature and convert it to celsius


float reading = analogRead(sensorPin);  
float voltage = reading * 5.0 / 1024.0;
float temp = voltage * 100 ;
  
 // print out the value you read:
 Serial.print(temp); 
 
 Serial.print(" \xC2\xB0");
 // print out the value you read, and skip next line
 Serial.println("C");
 delay(1000); 
}
```

### Task 2: Basic Circuit with the TI Kit

#### Goal
Now that you understand the basics of the TI Kit, it is time to begin using sensors to solve various problems. In this task, you will simply be building a circuit using the TI Kit to play a song that you should know. Can you guess it? To do this, you will need to complete the following:
1.	Open the {download}`Task1c_Song <class_files\class02a\buzzer_purdue_fight_song.ino>` file in Energia. 
2.	Before compiling and uploading the sketch, first you need to add to the board. 
  a.	Connect the Grove Starter Kit Buzzer to J14 of the Boosterpack using the four-prong connector cable. 
  ```{figure} ./figures/class02a/figure2.png
    :name: fig:2

    Grove Starter Kit Buzzer Boosterpack Connection
  ```
  b.	Connect the Boosterpack underneath the TI Kit board.

  ```
3.	Upload and compile the Task1c_Song file. 
Then answer the following questions:
4.	Draw (by hand or via a computer) a block diagram of your set up on your answer document. 
5.	Record a sound clip of your buzzer playing the Purdue Fight Song and upload it along with your answer document.

/*
 Grove Buzzer

 The example uses a buzzer to play melodies. It sends a square wave of the 
 appropriate frequency to the buzzer, generating the corresponding tone.
 
 The circuit:
 * Buzzer attached to Pin 39 (J14 plug on Grove Base BoosterPack)

 * Note:
